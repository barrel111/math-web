# math for quarto

Just a bunch of commands for using math with quarto for HTML documents. Nothing fancy, just some unremarkable macros for MathJax.

## installing

```bash
quarto add barrel111/math-web
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory. If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.

## example

Here is the source code for a minimal example: [example.qmd](example.qmd).
